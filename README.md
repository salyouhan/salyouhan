## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Salma and Iâ€™m currently working on the CoGrammar Software Engineering bootcamp ðŸ”­.

Through it, I am learning Python :snake:. Some things I can do now are:
- :floppy_disk: creating, storing and mutating variables,
- :loop: iteration,
- :computer: conditional statements (boolean logic)

Here's a small code snippet as an idea:
```python
   for x in range(9):
     if x < 5:
        print("x is currently " + x + " which is less than 5!")
     else:
        print("x is bigger than 5 now!")
```

I look forward to learning much more :book:!
